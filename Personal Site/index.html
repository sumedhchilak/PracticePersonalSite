                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. I have experience with back-end and front-end web/application development (React, Node, JavaScript/HTML/CSS),
                        data analytics (Python and R), and cloud engineering. I have strong knowledge of Object Oriented Programming (Java) such as Data Structures and Algorithms, databases (SQL), and Machine Learning (NumPy, PyTorch, Selenium).
                        I also have an interest in cloud computing technologies and recently received my Amazon Web Services (AWS) Certification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a Computer Science student, I enjoy challenges and working together with a team to solve problems. I love researching about cutting-edge technologies and working on projects that can help and benefit society as a whole.
                        In my free time, I like to play the guitar, listen to music, workout, and go on excursions.
                        I am currently seeking SWE internship opportunities and can't wait to work with a team of talented individuals.
